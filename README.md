Project Overview:
This project is a microservice-based to-do application. It is composed of two main services:

User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and general user management.

Todo Service: Manages the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of to-do items.

The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to build and run in any environment.

This repository contains the following:

Source code for the User Service and Todo Service.

Dockerfiles for each service and a docker-compose.yml file for orchestrating them.

API documentation (to be provided in a separate file, e.g., Postman collection or OpenAPI spec).

Unit test cases for the core user stories.

Clear instructions to build and run the system, provided below
